# Ditto Data Streams

A Data Stream is a **low-latency, bidirectional, peer-to-peer channel of raw bytes**
between two reachable Ditto peers, opened on a named **topic**. Streams are ephemeral and
**never write to the Ditto store**: nothing is persisted, queried or converged. The app
defines its own wire format (Protobuf, JSON, raw frames). One peer **binds** a topic
(server role, gets an *acceptor*); another **connects** to it (client role); after that
both sides send and receive symmetrically
(<https://docs.ditto.live/sdk/latest/sync/data-streams>).

**Preview API, may change without notice.** Available in **Kotlin from 5.1.0** (Android and
JVM; the docs cover Android) with a per-file `@file:OptIn(com.ditto.kotlin.PreviewDataStreams::class)`,
and in **Swift from 5.2.0** only through `@_spi(PreviewDataStreams) import DittoSwift`
(not on 5.1.0; not in the Ditto docs). No other SDK documents it. State the preview
status and the version floor whenever you recommend it.

Read only the reference the task needs; per-language code is in
[`kotlin-sdk/references/data-streams.md`](../kotlin-sdk/references/data-streams.md) and
[`swift-sdk/references/data-streams.md`](../swift-sdk/references/data-streams.md).

## When to use streams, and when not

Use Data Streams for **real-time, high-frequency or ephemeral** bytes that one reachable
peer needs *now* and nobody needs later: sensor readings, telemetry, live cursor or stroke
previews, audio frames, RPC-style control messages. Use **document sync** (and
`sync-subscriptions`) when the data must persist, be queried with DQL, reach peers that
are offline now, or converge across the whole mesh; use an **attachment** for a large
blob that belongs to a document. Most apps use both: the whiteboard reference app streams
live strokes and ships committed operations over a reliable stream, while profiles stay in
documents.

"Point-to-point" is logical: NGN routes a stream through intermediate peers when the two
ends are not directly connected, but the *application* still talks to exactly one peer per
stream (<https://docs.ditto.live/sdk/latest/sync/data-streams>).

## The lifecycle, end to end

1. **Receiver binds** a topic with a reliability mode and **keeps the acceptor alive**.
   Only one acceptor per topic at a time (executed: a second bind fails).
2. **Sender discovers** the receiver's peer key through **presence** (sync must be
   running). Presence proves the peer is reachable, **not** that it has bound the topic.
3. **Sender connects** to that peer key on the topic, with the **same reliability**
   (mismatch is rejected: `Rejected(ConnectionRejected)`, executed).
4. **Receiver's bind callback fires** with a **candidate**. The candidate is valid only
   inside the callback: **open it there, or `take()` it** and close the taken one later.
   Use after the callback throws "Attempted to use a DittoStreamCandidate after it was
   closed" (executed).
5. **Sender's connect block receives a candidate** too; `connect` does **not** open it
   for you. Open it in the block (or `take()`), return the stream.
6. **Both send and receive.** The receive callback runs on the connection's **driver
   thread**: copy the payload out, hand it to a queue, return.
7. **Either side closes.** Closing the **acceptor unbinds the topic but does not close
   streams already open on it** (executed); close those yourself. A stream closed on one
   side reports `ClosedByRemote` on the other (executed).

Streams **never reconnect by themselves**. A closed stream stays closed until the app opens
a new one; expect early connects to fail while the other side is still starting, and retry
with bounded backoff (<https://docs.ditto.live/sdk/latest/sync/data-streams>).

## Reliability

| | Reliable | Unreliable |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery | in order, or the connection fails | may be lost, reordered, duplicated |
| Latency | higher | lowest |
| Compression | optional LZ4 (`requestCompression`) | not applicable |
| Use for | control messages, RPC, ordered file chunks, committed operations | frames superseded by the next one: audio, sensors, live cursors |

Neither mode is once-only; tolerate duplicates. `Sent` means "handed to the local
transport", not "the receiver's app processed it". Binder and connector must agree
(<https://docs.ditto.live/sdk/latest/sync/data-streams>).

## Sending

Check `maxSendSize` before every send; pick **one** send mode per message:
`send` (await a terminal `DittoSendStatus`: `Sent`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`; treat
`Unknown` as terminal too), `sendAndForget` (no status, least overhead, fits unreliable
frames), or `send` with a monitoring block (`currentStatus` / `awaitStatusChange`) for
backpressure. **Connect once and reuse the stream**; a connect per message defeats the
purpose and overlaps attempts (<https://docs.ditto.live/sdk/latest/sync/data-streams>).
Topics match `^[a-zA-Z0-9_ ]{1,15}$` (`Err(InvalidTopic)` otherwise, executed).

## Setup

Data Streams run over **NGN** (next-generation networking), which must be on **before the
instance is created**: the environment variable `DITTO_NETWORK_ENABLE_NGN=true` (Android
`Os.setenv` in `Application.onCreate()`; the process environment on the JVM), or on 5.2.0
`systemParameters = { network_enable_ngn: true }` in the config. Keep
`replication_over_ngn` (`DITTO_REPLICATION_OVER_NGN`) **false** in the preview unless every
peer that must replicate sets the same value. Start sync so presence can discover peers.
**No TCP listener is required**; if you do change transports, modify the current config,
never a fresh one (every transport off). [setup-and-transports.md](references/setup-and-transports.md).

## Anti-patterns

- Moving a candidate out of its callback without `take()`, or not closing a taken one.
- Expecting `connect` to open the candidate, or returning before opening it.
- Retaining the inbound message or send-operation wrapper beyond its callback.
- Blocking, decoding, database or UI work inside the receive callback.
- Assuming closing the acceptor closes its streams, or that a stream reconnects.
- `waitUntilClosed` used as if it closed anything; `closeSync`/`closeAndWait` does.
- Calling `connect` inside a presence callback; copy the key out and connect elsewhere.
- Per-message connects; mismatched reliability; a topic outside the pattern; a payload
  over `maxSendSize`; two acceptors on one topic; a fresh transport config.
- Treating reliable as "guaranteed" or once-only, or as a substitute for document sync.
