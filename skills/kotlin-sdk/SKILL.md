# Ditto Kotlin SDK

Use the shipping API: on v5 everything is `DittoFactory.create(DittoConfig)`,
`ditto.sync`, `ditto.store` with DQL, and `suspend`/Flow observers; the v4
`Ditto(dependencies, identity)` constructor and legacy collection API are gone.
Establish the version line first (`com.ditto:ditto-kotlin` = v5, `live.ditto:ditto` =
v4, Android-only); emit v5 code by default and say which version you assumed. Do not
invent APIs from memory — the v4→v5 surface changed completely.

Read only the reference sections the task needs; inspect a long file's contents first.
Do not preload all references or the README (the capability/evidence map).

## What this skill does

Writes and reviews Ditto Kotlin code: Gradle setup, initialization, authentication,
DQL store access, sync, observers and Flows, attachments, presence, transports, object
lifetimes, threading, errors and testing. Supports **4.14.x (LTS), 5.0.x and 5.1.x** on
**Android** (both lines) and **plain JVM** (5.x only).

## When to use this skill

Use this skill for **Kotlin** Ditto code: API shape, initialization, object
lifetimes, threading, error types, and build configuration.

Hand off rather than restating; each row names a public URL in case the concept skill
is not installed:

| Question | Skill, if installed | Otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| DQL syntax, operators, statement semantics | `write-dql` | <https://docs.ditto.live/dql/dql> |
| Which CRDT type, embed vs split, document size, `dql_strict_mode` | `data-modeling` | <https://docs.ditto.live/key-concepts> |
| What a subscription is, mesh propagation | `sync-subscriptions` | <https://docs.ditto.live/sdk/latest/sync/syncing-data> |
| Transport selection strategy, platform radios | `ditto-mesh-networking` | <https://docs.ditto.live/sdk/latest/sync/customizing-transport-configurations> |
| v4 → v5 migration procedure | — | <https://docs.ditto.live/sdk/latest/migration-guides/kotlin-v4> and <https://docs.ditto.live/sdk/latest/migration-guides/kotlin-dql> |

## Supported versions and packages

Packages: `com.ditto:ditto-kotlin` (v5; KMP root — Gradle resolves `-android` / `-jvm`)
and `live.ditto:ditto` (4.14.x, Android-only). Published API reference:
<https://software.ditto.live/kotlin/ditto-kotlin/5.1.0/api-reference/>.

**[`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md) owns every fact that differs
across version lines**, including package coordinates per version and the minimum
toolchain. **When the user's version is unknown, emit 5.1.x code and say which version
you assumed.** v4 and v5 are different APIs, not two versions of one.

## Capability exceptions

Full twenty-row evidence map: [README.md](README.md), for capability reviews only.

| ID | Capability | Support | Required caveat |
|---|---|---|---|
| CAP-13 | Presence graph and connection requests | partial | Graph, metadata and `observe()` are docs-verified; `connectionRequestHandler` only fires with a second peer and was not executed. [presence.md](references/presence.md) |
| CAP-20 | Preview and platform-specific APIs | preview | Data Streams: 5.1.0-only, Kotlin-only, `@file:OptIn(com.ditto.kotlin.PreviewDataStreams::class)`, "breaking changes without notice". Multicast: beta from 5.1.0, off by default. [preview.md](references/preview.md) |

## Minimum viable app

Open → subscribe → observe → write (JVM shown; on Android hold the instance in
`Application`; no `ditto-binaries` classifier is needed there):

```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
    val ditto = DittoFactory.create(
        DittoConfig(
            databaseId = "my-app",
            connect = DittoConfig.Connect.SmallPeersOnly(),
            persistenceDirectory = "/tmp/ditto-data",
        )
    )
    ditto.setOfflineOnlyLicenseToken(System.getenv("DITTO_OFFLINE_LICENSE"))
    ditto.sync.start()

    val subscription = ditto.sync.registerSubscription("SELECT * FROM cars")
    val observer = ditto.store.registerObserver("SELECT * FROM cars") { result ->
        println("cars: ${result.items.size}")   // extract inside the lambda!
    }
    ditto.store.execute(
        "INSERT INTO cars DOCUMENTS (:car) ON ID CONFLICT DO UPDATE",
        mapOf("car" to mapOf("_id" to "car1", "make" to "Toyota"))
    )

    observer.close(); subscription.close(); ditto.sync.stop(); ditto.close()
}
```

## Concurrency and threading model

Read [concurrency.md](references/concurrency.md) for the per-API table and reasoning.
Core constraints:

- **Observer handlers start on the SDK's scope: the main thread on Android
  (`MainScope()`), `Dispatchers.Default` on JVM** — source-verified and executed on a
  Pixel. Treat every handler as UI-thread code.
- **Hop inside the handler**: `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` for extraction and decode,
  then plain data back to the UI. The result stays open while the handler is suspended.
  **`.flowOn()` does not reach the `observe()` transform** — it runs on the SDK scope.
- `DittoFactory.create`, `sync.start()/stop()`, `registerSubscription`,
  `registerObserver` are **not** suspend. `store.execute`, `store.collect`,
  `auth.login`, attachment fetches **are** suspend.
- Handlers are **serialized with back-pressure**: the next event is produced only after
  the handler returns, coalescing intermediate changes. Never `launch` per event, never
  `.buffer()`; use `.conflate()`/`stateIn` for latest-only UI, `collect()` for ordered
  pipelines.
- Cancelling the collecting scope (`viewModelScope`, `lifecycleScope`) closes an
  `observe()`/`collect()` observer; a `registerObserver` handle needs `close()`.
- `expirationHandler` is a property holding a **suspend** lambda — call `login` directly
  in its body, never inside `launch { }`.

## Object lifetimes and retention

One `Ditto` per process, owned by `Application`/a DI singleton (Android) or a top-level
holder (JVM); closing it closes every child resource. Retain `DittoSyncSubscription`
and `registerObserver` handles so you can `close()` them; **never retain
`DittoQueryResult` or its items** — they die when the handler returns
(`IllegalStateException: Query result item has already been closed.`). Flows from
`observe()`/`collect()` need no handle: the collecting scope is the lifetime. Do not
cache `ditto.sync.subscriptions` or `ditto.store.observers`; they are live views. Handle
table and per-component cleanup: [lifetimes.md](references/lifetimes.md).

## Anti-patterns

Read [anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) for wrong/right forms.

- Returning `result.items` (or the result) from a handler or `observe()` transform:
  `Query result item has already been closed.` / "You must not return DittoQueryResult".
- An exception escaping a `registerObserver` handler: the SDK logs
  `Unhandled exception in observer event handler` and **closes the observer**.
- `.buffer()` on an `observe()` chain: unbounded queue, eventual OOM.
- `scope.launch { … }` per event inside a handler: lost ordering, closed-item crashes.
- `.flowOn(Dispatchers.IO)` to move decoding off main: no effect on the transform.
- Casting `item.value["x"] as String`: `ClassCastException` — use `.stringOrNull` or
  `jsonString()`.
- `setExpirationHandler(…)` does not compile; `launch` around `auth.login` abandons it.
- Plain `INSERT` of an existing `_id`: `Identifier conflict … FAIL conflict policy` —
  add `ON ID CONFLICT DO UPDATE`.
- JVM without `ditto-binaries`: `Unable to find binary 'libdittoall…'` on create.

## Version differences

| Concern | 4.14.x | 5.0.x / 5.1.x |
|---|---|---|
| Package / namespace | `live.ditto:ditto`, `live.ditto.*` (Android-only) | `com.ditto:ditto-kotlin`, `com.ditto.kotlin.*` (Android + JVM) |
| Initialization | `Ditto(deps, DittoIdentity.…)` | `DittoFactory.create(DittoConfig(…))`, not suspend |
| Start sync | `ditto.startSync()` | `ditto.sync.start()` |
| Mutating DQL | requires `ditto.disableSyncWithV3()` first (else `StoreError: … disable sync with V3 …`, executed) | works by default |
| Query model | legacy collection API (deprecated) + DQL | DQL only, via `ditto.store.execute` |
| Observers | non-suspend callback, `DittoSignalNext` | suspend handler / `observe()` Flow / `collect()` |
| Errors | `DittoError` | `DittoException` sealed hierarchy |
| On-disk store | default dir `ditto` | default dir `ditto-{databaseId}` for new stores; a default-path v4 store is picked up |
